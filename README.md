----

Fundy is a financial management app heavily oriented towards Venezuelans. The goal of the app is to
help manage all of the user's funds in order to achieve better financial planning.

### What the app CAN do

- Keep track of your account's balances.
- Record monthly expenses.
- Record savings.
- Record debts.
- Calculate three different overall balances:
  - **Brute balance:** Total balance between all the accounts.
  - **Net balance:** Brute balance - all of the unpaid monthly expenses and debts.
  - **Usable balance:** Net balance - all of the recorded savings.
- Easily display equivalences between Bs and USD.
- Show the updated Bs-USD conversions.
- Help with the calculations of USD conversions to Bs.

### What the app CAN'T do

- Automatically update each account's balance.
- Give advice on financial decisions.

### Non-financial Features

- Customizable theme colors, one for light mode and one for dark mode.

----

Since the app is primarily designed for use in Venezuela, some features, such as the Bs currency 
options, may not be as useful when used outside the country. However, these options don't limit 
the use of the app if ignored, which means users from outside Venezuela that work with USD and 
USDT funds can still enjoy the features of the app.

All the data is stored and encrypted locally on the device, the app only connects to the internet to
fetch the Bs-USD conversions and USDT-USD conversion rates.
